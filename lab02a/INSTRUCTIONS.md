1. Write a single Java output statement that prints a message saying "Hello  yourname, welcome to Java!" (replacing yourname with...) and then moves to the next line.
2. Do the same thing, but with three separate output statements, one for "Hello", one for yourname, and one for the remainder of the message.
3. Modify your solution so that it has a constant for yourname, appropriately initialised, and uses that to print out the same message. What happens ifyou try changing yourname in the program.
4. Make yourname a variable. Initialise it in the program code (not when you declare it!) Have your program output the same message again.
5. Modify your solution so that it asks the user to enter their name, reads it from the keyboard, and then prints the same message.
6. Extend your program such that it asks the user to enter their age, as well as their name, and then prints that out on the line after the previousone.
